Game making library for Javascript with the Canvas element.

This library abstracts away boring stuff such as game loop, mouse, keyboard API calls, etc etc etc. All that is left to do is to implement the meat of the following functions:

//executes once in beginning
function myinit(){
}

//executes every tick, FPS (typically around 30-50) times a second
function update(){
}

//executes every tick right after update()
function draw(){
    ctx.clearRect(0,0,WIDTH,HEIGHT);
}

//event function when a click occurs. x,y coordinates of click are given
function mouseClick(x, y){
}

//events for key up and down. key value is passed in.
function keyUp(key){
}
function keyDown(key){
}

Also included:
vector2D.js that implements a 2D vector object
randf(), randn(), randi() functions that generate random uniform and gaussian numbers
